    "If we do not want user to go through complex coding in the background of interface, abstraction method in OOPs can be used.\n",
    "In abstraction method, we can store all the codes in a perticular class, and access of that code can be given into another class.\n",
    "So, user need not go through or need not do any changes into our main class, but he can able to use code present in main class through some another\n",
    "class. User just need to enter parameters and call the function. To do abstraction in python one need to import module 'abc'.\n",
    "The method without ant implementation is abstract method. The main class in following example is 'shape', which contain two abstract methods\n",
    "'rectangle' and 'circle', and there is no any implementation, just pass command. The two subclasses 'area' and 'perimeter' have implementations.\n",
    "class area and perimeter are then assigned into variable area and perimeter respectively. When we call area or perimeter, we can select method\n",
    "from main class 'shape' and after providing inputs(i.e parameters, radius, length, etc) we get the respective value.\n",
